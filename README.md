This purpose of this project is to model the water-flooding process in an underground reservoir where the mathematical formulation of the flow has been simplified into a single, one-dimensional, nonlinear, partial differential equation.

Both semi-analytical and numerical solutions were found to model the flow and a series of analyses were completed to compare the solutions.
